Sheltering the harvest-hut
Of the autumn rice-field;
And my sleeves are growing wet
With the moisture dripping through.

The spring has passed
And the summer come again;
For the silk-white robes,
So they say, are spread to dry
On the "Mount of Heaven's Perfume".

Oh, the foot-drawn trail
Of the mountain-pheasant's tail
Drooped like down-curved branch!
Through this long, long-dragging night
Must I lie in bed alone?

Perfect whiteness laid
On Mount Fuji's lofty peak
By the drift of falling snow.

Sad (how sad!) the autumn is.

If I see that bridge
That is spanned by flights of magpies
Across the arc of heaven
Made white with a deep-laid frost,
Then the night is almost past.

That rose on Mount Mikasa
In the land of Kasuga?

The Monk Kisen
My lowly hut is
Southeast from the capital.
Thus I choose to live.

Men have named a "Mount of Gloom".

Travelers who go or come
Over parting ways --

The gate of "Meeting Hill".

Over the wide sea
Towards its many distant isles

Will the fishing boats thronged here
Proclaim my journey to the world?

The Monk Henjou
Let the winds of heaven
Blow through the paths among the clouds
And close their gates.
Then for a while I could detain
These messengers in maiden form.

From Tsukuba's peak

Like the river's quiet deeps.

While my garment's hanging sleeves
Are speckled with falling snow.

I hide from people's eyes.

Even for a time
Short as a piece of the reeds

Until the moon of daybreak,
In the long month, has appeared.

It is by its breath
That autumn's leaves of trees and grass
Are wasted and driven.
So they call this mountain wind
The wild one, the destroyer.

If your name is true,
Trailing vine of "Meeting Hill",
Isn't there some way,
Hidden from people's gaze,
That you can draw her to my side?

The emperor's pilgrimage.

In a mountain village grows
Only deeper, when

Are withered: troubling thoughts.

I by chance might pluck the flower.

Lightened the dim scene,
Yoshino's village lay
In a haze of falling snow.

There is a wattled barrier
Built by the busy wind.
Yet it's only maple leaves,
Powerless to flow away.

Why do the cherry's new-blown blooms
Scatter like restless thoughts?

No longer offer comfort.

Has the wandering moon come home?

How the myriad unstrung gems
Are scattered everywhere around

I sleep alone,
While all through the frosty night
I hear a cricket's lonely sound.

Nijou In no Sanuki
Waga sode wa
Shiohi ni mienu
Oki no ishi no
Hito koso shirane
Kawaku ma mo nashi
Lady Sanuki
Like a rock at sea,
At ebb-tide hidden from view,
Is my tear-drenched sleeve:
Never for a moment dry,
And no one knows it is there.

Kamakura no Udaijin
Yo no naka wa
Tsune ni mo ga mo na
Nagisa kogu
Ama no obune no
Tsuna de kanashi mo
Minamoto no Sanetomo
If only our world
Could be always as it is!
How moving the sight
Of the little fishing boat
Drawn by ropes along the bank.

Sangi Masatsune
Miyoshino no
Yama no akikaze
Sayo fukete
Furusato samuku
Koromo utsu nari
Fujiwara no Masatsune
From Mount Yoshino
Blows a chill, autumnal wind.
In the deepening night
The ancient village shivers:
Sounds of beating cloth I hear.

Daisoujou Jien
Okenaku
Ukiyo no tami ni
Ou kana
Waga tatsu soma ni
Sumizome no sode
Abbot Jien
From the monastery
On Mount Hiei I look out
On this world of tears,
And though I am unworthy,
I shield it with my black sleeves.

Nyuudo Saki no Dajoudaijin
Hana sasou
Arashi no niwa no
Yuki nara de
Furi yuku mono wa
Waga mi nari keri
Fujiwara no Kintsune
Not the snow of flowers,
That the hurrying wild wind whirls
Round the garden court:
What withers and falls away
In this place is I myself.

Gon Chuunagon Sadaie
Konu hito o
Matsuho no ura no
Yunagi ni
Yaku ya moshio no
Mi mo kogare tsutsu
Fujiwara no Teika
Like the salt sea-weed,
Burning in the evening calm.
On Matsuo's shore,
All my being is aflame,
Awaiting her who does not come.

Ju'nii Ietaka
Kaze soyogu
Nara no ogawa no
Yugure wa
Misogi zo natsu no
Shirushi nari keru
Fujiwara no Ietaka
To Nara's brook comes
Evening, and the rustling winds
Stir the oak-trees' leaves.
Not a sign of summer left
But the sacred bathing there.

Gotoba In
Hito mo oshi
Hito mo urameshi
Ajiki naku
Yo o omou yue ni
Mono omou mi wa
Emperor Gotoba
For some men I grieve;
Some men are hateful to me;
And this wretched world
To me, with all my sadness,
Is a place of misery.

Juntoku In
Momoshiki ya
Furuki nokiba no
Shinobu ni mo
Nao amari aru
Mukashi nari keri
Emperor Juntoku
In this ancient house,
Paved with a hundred stones,
Ferns grow in the eaves;
But numerous as they are,
My old memories are more.
